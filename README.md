# hello-world
I'm a new student to front end development, and following through Aaron Gustafson's " Moden Web Design" primer on Aquent's Gymnasium.
I'm not a very good typist so this alone will be a challenge, but I'm very interestid in delving into how websites work.
I'm looking forward to (at the very least) understanding how each language performs it's duties, and hopefully learn enough to tinker around with building a little interactivity into a personal website in the future.
